<h1><b>Lorem Ipsum</b> is simply dummy text of the <i> printing and typesetting industry</i>. Lorem Ipsum has been the industry's standard dummy text ever since the 1500<sup>s</sup>, when an unknown printer took a galley of type and scrambled it to make a type specimen book. <strong>has survived not only five centuries, but also the leap into electronic typesetting, remaining essentially unchanged</strong>
<em>It was popularised in the 1960<sup>s</sup> with the release of Letraset sheets</em> containing <mark> Lorem Ipsum passages,</mark> and more recently with desktop publishing software like <del>Aldus PageMaker</del> including <sub>versions</sub> of <ins>Lorem Ipsum.</ins>
